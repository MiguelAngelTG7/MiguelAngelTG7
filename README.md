## 🚀 About Me  
I’m **Miguel Ángel Torres Gallardo**, also known as **Migz** — a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with a heart for technology, education, and impact.  
I believe in using technology not just to build apps, but to **empower people**. My mission is to make tech more **accessible**, helping others improve their quality of life through tools like **English for Everyone, AI for Everyone, and Startups for Everyone**.  

✨ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you might find me teaching, creating music, or exploring theology & philosophy.
